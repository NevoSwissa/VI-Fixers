# VI-Fixers - RPG Mission Framework for FiveM

Welcome to VI-Fixers, a modular, story-driven mission framework for FiveM, inspired by games like Cyberpunk 2077. It was built as a sandbox for learning, experimenting, and designing RPG quests. I never finished it as a complete product but it grew into something Iâ€™m proud of.
So Iâ€™m sharing it in full. Free to use & Fully documented.
Feel free to learn from it, use parts of it, or even expand it into something bigger.

## ðŸŽ¨ What is VI-Fixers?

VI-Fixers is a full-featured framework built from the ground up to support cinematic, branching, and highly modular missions. It provides tools for:

- Dialogue scenes (with audio, subtitles, and animations)
- Interactive phone calls and messages
- World blips, audio systems, and screen effects
- Dynamic objective systems
- Enemy AI, stealth mechanics, and more...
